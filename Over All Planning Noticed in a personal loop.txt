Noticed that I am constantly second guessing the work of what I want to accomplish with this application.
First off, I am have a plan that is greater than I thought so here is the outline.
1) Over all make an application that could be used on the iOs and android phones, as well the computers respectfully.
2) Set goals to reach one in a practical manner.
3) Starting off with getting a program I want on the computer side of things with my windows 10 computer systems.
4) Get that avaible through downloading with github or the sort.
5) Next focus on the phone app that I have android. Using android studios.
6) When money permits or when I can barrow family member iOS try to develop on using it after better understanding developing with windows.
7) At this point it would be done and would just be a matter of deciding to buy an iOs device or not and how I want to update it before official launch.

So step 3) I plan on writing out more on because I it will braking down the scatter plan and molding it into small steps one after the other.
a) First one I will be brake down is eclipse java source reading a spread sheet of info that could be updated and worked with.
b) develop a solution
c) develop next solutions based on monkey knowledge.
d) add constraints users can apply and adding to it.
